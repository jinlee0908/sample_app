# Of course, this is essentially a duplicate of the helper in Listing 4.2, 
# but having two independent methods allows us to catch any typos in the base 
# title. This is dubious design, though, and a better (slightly more advanced) 
# approach, which tests the original full_title helper directly, appears in the 
# exercises (Section 5.6)
